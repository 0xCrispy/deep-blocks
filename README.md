# deep-blocks

We can try to gather some ideas to take a shot at.  

1. Arb bot (i.e arb between stable/stable).  
2. Liquidation bot (i.e bots for aave, dydx, smaller protocols...).  
3. We fork an existing defi protocol... lol jk? 
4. We keep brainstorming (analytics, nft + ai) what excites us?  

If you want to work on another idea, you can still clone the repo, make a new dir and put your code in there and push.
